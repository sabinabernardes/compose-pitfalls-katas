# Compose Pitfalls Katas

Refactoring katas for real-world Jetpack Compose pitfalls.

## What is this?
A set of small, repeatable refactoring exercises (“katas”) that start from intentionally flawed Compose code and guide you toward clean, testable, production-grade solutions.

## Who is this for?
- Android devs learning Compose in real-world scenarios
- Developers preparing for interviews
- Teams building shared Compose practices

## Katas (MVP)
- Kata 01 — Recomposition & State Placement
- Kata 02 — Side Effects & One-off Events
- Kata 03 — Flow as a State Machine (Testable)

## How to use this repo
This repo is designed as a refinement log:
- Issues capture decisions and open questions
- PRs add/adjust documentation and code incrementally

## Project status
- Current phase: Documentation refinement
- Next phase: Implement the base sample app + kata branches

## Docs
- docs/00-vision.md
